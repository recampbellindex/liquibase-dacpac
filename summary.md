# DACPAC Deployment - Implementation Summary

## Core Implementation Patterns

This repository demonstrates SQL Server DACPAC deployment integration with Liquibase using the executeCommand change type. Key patterns include:

- **SqlPackage integration**: Uses Microsoft's SqlPackage utility through Liquibase's executeCommand change type for DACPAC deployment
- **Script-based automation**: Implements shell scripts to handle DACPAC deployment parameters and environment configuration
- **Versioned DACPAC management**: Demonstrates how to manage multiple DACPAC versions within a Liquibase changelog structure
- **Quality checks integration**: Shows how to apply Liquibase Pro quality checks to DACPAC-based deployments
- **Flow-based deployment**: Uses Liquibase Flow to orchestrate complex DACPAC deployment workflows

## Reusable Components

- **SqlPackage wrapper scripts**: The deployment scripts can be adapted for any DACPAC-based deployment scenario
- **executeCommand pattern**: The changeSet structure provides a template for integrating any external deployment tool with Liquibase
- **Environment configuration**: The exports.sh script pattern can be reused for environment-specific DACPAC deployments
- **Quality checks configuration**: The Flow and checks configuration can be applied to any DACPAC deployment pipeline
- **DACPAC versioning strategy**: The approach to managing multiple DACPAC versions can be standardized across projects

## Customer Adaptation Points

- **Connection parameters**: Update SqlPackage connection strings and authentication methods for customer SQL Server instances
- **DACPAC sources**: Adapt scripts to pull DACPAC files from customer build artifacts, repositories, or package managers
- **Deployment options**: Customize SqlPackage deployment options (/p: parameters) for customer-specific requirements
- **Environment handling**: Modify scripts to support customer environment management and promotion workflows
- **Integration points**: Connect with customer CI/CD systems, artifact repositories, and deployment orchestration tools

## Common Customizations

- **Authentication methods**: Implement Windows Authentication, Azure AD, or SQL Server authentication as needed
- **Deployment validation**: Add pre/post-deployment validation scripts and data verification
- **Rollback strategies**: Implement DACPAC rollback procedures using schema snapshots or backup/restore patterns
- **Parallel deployments**: Extend for multi-database or multi-server DACPAC deployments
- **Monitoring integration**: Add deployment monitoring, logging, and notification capabilities

## Troubleshooting Patterns

- **SqlPackage installation**: Verify SqlPackage is installed and accessible in the deployment environment
- **DACPAC compatibility**: Ensure DACPAC target version matches SQL Server instance compatibility level
- **Permission issues**: Verify deployment account has appropriate SQL Server permissions for schema changes
- **Path resolution**: Handle DACPAC file path resolution across different operating systems and environments
- **Timeout handling**: Manage long-running DACPAC deployments with appropriate timeout configurations
